This leads to two primary issues:\n\n1. **Race Conditions** – Concurrent requests to the same endpoint or shared resources can corrupt state or produce inconsistent results.\n2. **Request Overload / Fatal Errors** – The client logs a high‑frequency “FATAL ERROR: Non‑local network connections are disabled” each time it attempts to reach `firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com` (IP 52.85.132.97). This indicates that the client repeatedly tries to establish outbound connections that are disallowed by policy or configuration.\n\n**Symptoms**  \n- Frequent FATAL ERROR logs for non‑local connections.\n- Potential data corruption or stale configuration due to race conditions during synchronization.\n- Observed overload of network traffic when Remote Settings attempts to sync.\n\n**Collected Log Snippets**  \n1. `[Remote Settings Client] Consider having a queue for Remote Settings network requests`  \n2. `[Remote Settings Client] High frequency FATAL ERROR: Non-local network connections are disabled and a connection attempt to firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (52.85.132.97) was made.`  \n3. `[Remote Settings Client] Fix race condition during synchronization`\n\n**Analysis & Hypothesis**  \n- The first log suggests the team is already aware of the need for a queue; the implementation is either missing or incomplete.\n- The fatal error indicates the Remote Settings client is attempting outbound connections that are blocked, potentially due to a security policy or configuration flag. Because requests are not queued, each retry occurs almost immediately, generating a flood of errors.\n- Race conditions during synchronization imply that multiple sync operations can run concurrently, leading to inconsistent state updates or corrupted local caches.\n\n**Recommended Fixes**  \n1. **Implement a Request Queue**  \n   - Serialize outbound Remote Settings requests or limit the number of concurrent connections (e.g., max 1–3).\n   - Use a retry policy with exponential backoff to avoid immediate repeat attempts after a failure.\n\n2. **Handle Non‑Local Connection Policy**  \n   - Verify the policy that blocks non‑local connections. If the intention is to allow these requests, update the configuration or whitelist the endpoint.\n   - If the policy is correct, adjust the Remote Settings client to detect the policy block and avoid repeated attempts (e.g., mark the request as “blocked” and skip further retries until policy changes).\n\n3. **Synchronize Access to Shared Resources**  \n   - Use proper locking or atomic operations around shared data structures during sync to eliminate race conditions.\n   - Consider implementing a “sync lock” that ensures only one sync operation can run at a time.\n\n4. **Logging & Monitoring**  \n   - Add more granular logs to trace the state of the request queue and the outcome of each request.\n   - Log retry attempts with timestamps to help identify patterns.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce (If Applicable)**  \n1. Enable Remote Settings in Firefox.  \n2. Trigger multiple sync events in rapid succession (e.g., by forcing sync via the developer console).  \n3. Observe the console or log output for concurrent request logs and the fatal error message.\n\n**Severity**  \nFunctionality Error – may cause incorrect or stale settings to be applied, potentially affecting user experience.\n\n**Attachments**  \n- Full log excerpt (as provided).  \n- Any relevant configuration files indicating non‑local connection policy (not included but recommended for debugging).\n\n---", "bug_report": "```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Remote Settings performs unqueued network requests, causing race conditions and request overload in Firefox\",\n  \"steps_to_reproduce\": [\n    \"Open Mozilla Firefox and ensure the Remote Settings feature is enabled.\",\n    \"Trigger multiple Remote Settings sync events in quick succession (e.g., via the developer console or by manually initiating sync).\",\n    \"Monitor the console or log output for concurrent network request entries and any fatal error messages.\"\n  ],\n  \"expected_result\": \"Remote Settings requests are serialized or limited, each request completes successfully, no race conditions occur, and no repeated fatal error logs appear.\",\n  \"actual_result\": \"Multiple concurrent network requests are sent to firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com, leading to race conditions and a flood of \\\"FATAL ERROR: Non-local network connections are disabled\\\" logs.\",\n  \"possible_cause\": \"The Remote Settings client lacks a request queue and proper retry/backoff logic; it also retries immediately on policy‑blocked connections, causing overload and race conditions on shared resources.\",\n  \"severity\": \"high\"\n}\n```"}

The issue appears to affect users who sync accounts and may be related to the account‑sync component.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**  \n1. Install and run the latest stable release of Firefox on a fresh profile.  \n2. Enable sync for bookmarks, history, and other data.  \n3. Close Firefox and leave it inactive for at least two weeks.  \n4. Reopen Firefox.  \n5. Observe that the bookmarks folder and the history list are empty.  \n\n*Alternative reproduction:*  \n- On a profile with a corrupted `bookmarkbackups` folder or after a manual history deletion, the same loss of bookmarks and history can be observed.\n\n**Expected Result**  \nFirefox should preserve bookmarks and history data between sessions, especially when using sync. The application should notify the user if data cannot be retrieved or if backups are missing, and it should provide a clear recovery path.\n\n**Actual Result**  \n- Bookmarks and history are missing entirely after inactivity.  \n- No warning or error message is displayed to the user.  \n- Restoring from the `bookmarkbackups` folder (if present) fails.  \n- In some reported cases, Firefox crashes or becomes unresponsive after deleting a large history archive.\n\n**Environment**  \n- **Browser:** Mozilla Firefox (latest stable release at the time of testing)  \n- **Platform:** Windows 10 / macOS 12 (replace with actual OS if known)  \n- **Profile:** Fresh profile with sync enabled  \n- **Sync Status:** Bookmarks and history enabled, account logged in  \n\n**Possible Category**  \nAccount / Sync – related to the synchronization service and local profile management.\n\n**Problem Type**  \nFunctionality Error – data loss and UI silence.\n\n**Additional Context**  \nThe user feedback and the collected information suggest a recurring pattern across multiple reported bugs:\n- Erasure of history (`[Bookmarks & History] Firefox erased most of my history in the past few days.`)  \n- Non‑responsiveness after mass history deletion (`[Bookmarks & History] Firefox not responding after deleting history collected over a month.`)  \n- Sudden disappearance of bookmarks (`[Bookmarks & History] Bookmarks gone suddenly and restoring from backup not working.`)  \n- Missing `bookmarkbackups` folder (`[Bookmarks & History] \"bookmarkbackups\" folder in my Firefox profile disappeared.`)  \n- Failure of the Clear History function (`[Bookmarks & History] Firefox DOES NOT \"Clear History\" - Several Versions over Last 6 Months.`)\n\nThese reports indicate a systemic issue with how Firefox handles data persistence, particularly when a profile is left dormant or when large amounts of data are manipulated.\n\n**Suggested Investigation / Fix**  \n1. Verify that the sync service correctly writes and retains bookmark/history data in the profile directory.  \n2. Ensure that the `bookmarkbackups` directory is created and maintained even during periods of inactivity.  \n3. Add a user notification when data cannot be retrieved from the local profile or from the sync service.  \n4. Investigate crash logs for cases where the browser becomes unresponsive after bulk history deletion.  \n5. Validate that the Clear History dialog correctly updates the underlying storage and does not silently fail.\n\n**Severity / Priority**  \nHigh – This bug leads to permanent data loss without user awareness, impacting user trust and satisfaction.\n\n---", "bug_report": "```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Bookmarks and History Disappear After Periods of Inactivity or Bulk Deletion (Sync / Local Persistence Failure)\",\n  \"steps_to_reproduce\": [\n    \"Create a new Firefox profile and install the latest stable release.\",\n    \"Enable sync for bookmarks and history.\",\n    \"Close Firefox and leave it inactive for at least two weeks.\",\n    \"Reopen Firefox and check the Bookmarks folder and History list – both are empty.\",\n    \"(Alternative) Corrupt the `bookmarkbackups` folder or delete a large history archive, then restart Firefox – the same loss of data is observed.\"\n  ],\n  \"expected_result\": \"Firefox should preserve bookmarks and history across sessions.

Summary**  \nIn Firefox on Windows 10 Professional, the user is unable to specify a custom URL for the New Tab page.

Navigate to `about:preferences#home` (or via Settings → Home).  \n3. Set a custom homepage URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).  \n4. Click “New Tab” (or press Ctrl+T).  \n5. Observe that the new tab opens as “Firefox Home” or “Blank”, not the custom URL.  \n\n**3. Expected Behavior**  \nA new tab should open the URL set in the homepage preferences, allowing a fully custom start page for every new tab.  \n\n**4. Actual Behavior**  \nThe new tab always defaults to the built‑in “Firefox Home” or “Blank”, ignoring the custom homepage setting.  \n\n**5.

Impact**  \nUsers who rely on a specific start page for each new tab (e.g., for productivity or quick access) cannot do so, reducing workflow efficiency and contradicting the customization options available for the home page.  \n\n**7. Possible Causes**  \n- The `browser.newtabpage.enabled` preference may override the custom URL setting.  \n- The feature to use the custom homepage for new tabs might have been removed in a recent release.  \n- An extension or policy could be enforcing the default New Tab page.  \n\n**8. Suggested Fix**  \n- Re‑enable or introduce a preference (e.g., `browser.newtabpage.url`) that allows users to set a custom URL for new tabs.  \n- Ensure the preference is documented in the release notes and the UI provides a clear option to change it.  \n- Provide a fallback to “Firefox Home” only when no custom URL is set.  \n\n**9.

The browser either does not prompt for microphone permission, or the permission is denied/blocked, resulting in no audio transmission. This issue appears to be related to Firefox’s site permission handling and its SSB (System Shared Browsing) mode, which does not allow microphone access for certain sites.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**  \n1. Open Firefox and navigate to https://voice.google.com.  \n2. Log in to your Google account.  \n3. Initiate a call (or join an existing call).  \n4. Observe that the microphone icon is muted or that the call does not transmit audio.  \n5. Check the microphone permission settings for Google Voice / Hangouts in Firefox (Preferences → Privacy & Security → Permissions → Microphone).  \n6. Notice that Firefox either does not show a prompt for microphone access or blocks access due to SSB mode.  \n7. Optionally, try a different site (e.g., https://meet.google.com) to confirm that the microphone works there, indicating the issue is site-specific.\n\n**Expected Result:**  \nFirefox should request microphone permission when a Google Voice call is started, and the user should be able to grant access. The microphone should then transmit audio correctly during the call.\n\n**Actual Result:**  \nFirefox either ignores the microphone choice or blocks permission via SSB mode, so no microphone input is available during the call. The caller is not heard.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- Similar issues reported for Gmail/Hangouts: “gmail (hangouts) not recognizing I have a microphone installed for Firefox 74.0 on Windows 10.”  \n- “Firefox ignores microphone choice” and “Firefox SSB mode does not allow permission control (cannot use microphone access)” have been logged as related.  \n- The problem appears to be a Firefox permission handling bug affecting Google Voice (and possibly Hangouts).\n\n**Suggested Fix / Investigation:**  \n- Verify that Firefox’s site permissions correctly prompt for microphone access for Google Voice domains.  \n- Check the SSB mode configuration and determine if disabling SSB for these sites restores microphone functionality.  \n- Ensure that Firefox updates correctly propagate to newer versions (e.g., 75+), as this issue may have been resolved in later releases.  \n\n---", "bug_report": "```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Microphone does not work during Google Voice calls in Firefox – microphone permissions appear blocked\",\n  \"steps_to_reproduce\": [\n    \"Open Firefox and navigate to https://voice.google.com.\",\n    \"Log in to your Google account.\",\n    \"Initiate a call (or join an existing call).\",\n    \"Observe that the microphone icon is muted or the call does not transmit audio.\",\n    \"Check the microphone permission settings for Google Voice / Hangouts in Firefox (Preferences → Privacy & Security → Permissions → Microphone).\",\n    \"Notice that Firefox either does not show a prompt for microphone access or blocks access due to SSB mode.\",\n    \"Optionally, try a different site (e.g., https://meet.google.com) to confirm that the microphone works there.\"\n  ],\n  \"expected_result\": \"Firefox should request microphone permission when a Google Voice call is started, and the user should be able to grant access.
