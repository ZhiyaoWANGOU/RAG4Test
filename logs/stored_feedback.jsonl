This behavior overrides the icon completely and cannot be suppressed by the CSS techniques that previously worked (e.g., custom user stylesheets targeting the `:not(:has(audio))` selector or the `-moz-tab-favicon` attribute). The icon remains even on discarded or muted tabs and causes visual clutter, especially in the compact tab bar where space is limited.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**  \n1. Open Firefox 143.  \n2. Navigate to any webpage that contains an audible media element (audio or video).  \n3. Start playback of the media.  \n4. Observe that the tab’s favicon is replaced by the speaker/mute icon.  \n5. Attempt to override the icon with custom CSS (e.g., setting `background-image` on the tab or using the `-moz-tab-favicon` property).  \n6. Verify that the icon still appears and the favicon remains hidden.\n\n**Expected Result**  \n- The tab should display its original favicon even when audio is playing.  \n- The speaker/mute icon should appear only when the tab is muted or when user settings explicitly enable it, and it should not replace the favicon.\n\n**Actual Result**  \n- The speaker/mute icon replaces the favicon in all cases where audio is playing.  \n- CSS overrides are ignored; the icon persists and cannot be removed or hidden.\n\n**Severity**  \nMedium – affects user interface clarity and user-configurable appearance.\n\n**Bug Category**  \n- UI / Interaction  \n- Configuration Issue  \n\n**Notes & References**  \n- Prior to the latest update, custom CSS solutions existed to hide or replace the audio icon. Those solutions are now ineffective.  \n- The issue appears consistent across both regular and compact tab bar modes.  \n- No relevant configuration options have been added to Firefox to control this behavior.  \n\n**Suggested Fix**  \nProvide a configuration option (e.g., `media.autoplay.enabled`) to control whether the audio icon should overlay favicons, or restore the ability for users to override the icon via CSS by re‑introducing the `-moz-tab-favicon` property. Alternatively, adjust the default behavior so that the icon overlays the favicon without removing it, or offer a themeable icon that can be suppressed.\n\n**Search** – None needed; the collected information suffices to create a meaningful bug report.\n(Online search insufficient)", "summary": "User feedback and online findings regarding removal of speaker/audio icon from tabs, including explanation that recent update has rendered existing CSS solutions ineffective."}

This problem has been reported by multiple users across various forums, suggesting a broader issue rather than a specific software bug. The common thread among these reports is the presence of \"ugly\" or \"pixelated\" fonts in system applications, which may be related to driver updates or font rendering issues.\n\nIt's worth noting that some users have suggested updating Windows and drivers as a potential solution, while others have recommended using font size changer tools or dark mode to mitigate the issue. However, these solutions are not universally effective, indicating a more complex underlying problem.\n\nOverall, the technical findings suggest that the bug report should focus on investigating the cause of font rendering issues in Windows 10, potentially involving driver updates, font configuration, or rendering algorithms."}
