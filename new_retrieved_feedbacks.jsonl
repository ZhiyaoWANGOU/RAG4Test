This can happen because Firefox creates a dedicated profile for each installation of Firefox . To recover your Firefox data and settings from another profile: Type about:profiles into the Firefox address bar and press the Enter Return key. This will open the About Profiles page. This page should list at least one profile and could list many. The profile that Firefox is currently using will have this under the profile name: This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted. Warning: Please do not delete any profiles. Don't use any Remove buttons. If you have another profile listed on this page, it may contain your missing profile data. You can click the Launch profile in new browser button to open another Firefox window using that profile. If the other profile doesn't contain your missing data, simply close that new window. If it does contain the missing data, you can set it as the profile that Firefox will open by default. Click the Set as default profile button for that profile, and Firefox will use it automatically the next time you open Firefox. If you can't recover your missing data this way, you may be able to manually recover data from another profile. See the Restore bookmarks, passwords, and data from an old Firefox profile article for details. For more information about managing Firefox profiles, see the Profile Manager article."], "weights": {"w1": 0.4991, "w2": 0.5009, "beta": 0.1874}}

Additionally, we sometimes have to create exceptions for this list to ensure that websites continue to work as intended. Suspected Fingerprinters To combat fingerprinting attempts that Firefox cannot block (because we are unaware of the script, or because it is integrated with the site in a way such that it cannot be blocked), Firefox will limit the information it exposes to the web at all times, for every webpage. (Potentially limited to Private Browsing only, per the settings above.) The specific attributes that Firefox alters are: Random data is introduced to background images when the website reads back the image. If a website merely renders data to the background, it will render without alteration. Although typically this does not happen, if the website reads the image data in the background (and potentially displays it to you again), it will have subtle noise that may affect how the image is displayed.
